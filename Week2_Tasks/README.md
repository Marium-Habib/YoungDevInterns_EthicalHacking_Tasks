**🛡️ Week 2 – Scanning, Enumeration & Vulnerabilities**

✅ Task Overview  
In Week 2 of the YoungDev Interns – Ethical Hacking Program, I advanced into scanning and enumeration techniques, system hacking basics, and vulnerability analysis. The goal was to identify weak points in target systems, understand password security, and explore known exploits using both manual and automated tools.

🔍 Scanning & Enumeration  
- Performed advanced Nmap scans including version and OS detection  
- Used Nmap scripting engine (NSE) for detailed information gathering  
- Explored web vulnerabilities and hidden directories using:
  - Nikto – web server vulnerability scanner  
  - Dirb and Gobuster – brute-force directory enumeration tools

🔐 System Hacking Basics  
- Studied password cracking concepts and hash mechanisms  
- Used John the Ripper and Hydra for brute-force attacks  
- Practiced attacks using common wordlists like `rockyou.txt`  
- Exploited Metasploitable2 with `msfconsole`

🛠️ Vulnerability Analysis  
- Searched known vulnerabilities using `Searchsploit` (Exploit-DB)  
- Learned about CVEs and their role in vulnerability databases  
- Explored system scanning with OpenVAS and Nessus (where applicable)

💡 Hands-On Tasks  
- Cracked a password-protected ZIP/PDF file using dictionary attack  
- Performed system enumeration on a vulnerable Linux machine
