üõ°Ô∏è Week 3 & 4 ‚Äì Exploitation and Privilege Escalation

‚úÖ Task Overview  
During Weeks 3 and 4 of the YoungDev Interns ‚Äì Ethical Hacking Program, I focused on exploiting system vulnerabilities, escalating privileges on compromised machines, and hacking web applications. This phase deepened my understanding of real-world attack techniques using tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and sqlmap. I also practiced exploiting vulnerable virtual machines from VulnHub to gain hands-on experience.

üí• Exploitation Frameworks  

- Utilized **Metasploit** for discovering and exploiting known system vulnerabilities  
- Launched various payloads to gain shell access on both Linux and Windows targets  
- Demonstrated post-exploitation actions after successful access  

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Privilege Escalation  

- Learned Linux privilege escalation techniques using:
  - **SUID binaries**
  - **Misconfigured cron jobs**
  - **Manipulated environment variables**
- Practiced Windows privilege escalation using:
  - **Unquoted service paths**
  - **Weak service permissions**
  - **Access tokens**

üåê Web Application Hacking  

- Studied **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** including:
- Used **Burp Suite** to intercept and modify HTTP requests  
- Performed SQL Injection manually and automated attacks using **sqlmap**

üí° Hands-On Tasks  

- Exploited a vulnerable VM from **VulnHub** (e.g., Mr. Robot or Basic Pentesting)  
- Achieved **root/admin access** through privilege escalation  
- Combined exploitation and post-exploitation techniques to fully compromise the system
