**🛡️ Week 1 – Foundations of Ethical Hacking**

✅ Task Overview
In Week 1 of the YoungDev Interns – Ethical Hacking Program, I focused on establishing the core foundation required for ethical hacking. This included environment setup, understanding key networking protocols, hands-on exploration of Linux tools, and initial reconnaissance techniques.

 🖥️ Environment Setup
- Installed Kali Linux using VirtualBox
- Configured Metasploitable 2 as a vulnerable virtual machine for testing

 🧑‍💻 Linux Terminal Skills
- Learned and practiced essential Linux commands:
  - 'ifconfig', 'ping', 'netstat', 'traceroute', 'nmap'
  - File handling: 'cd', 'ls', 'touch', 'cat', 'chmod', 'mkdir', etc.
  - Privilege elevation: 'sudo', 'sudo su', 'passwd'

🌐 Networking Basics
- Understood core networking concepts:
  - IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, DHCP, DNS, Netmask, TCP/IP Model
- Explored the difference between TCP and UDP
- Analyzed packet structure using Wireshark

🕵️‍♀️ Footprinting & Reconnaissance
- Learned about Passive vs Active Reconnaissance
- Used reconnaissance tools:
  - 'whois' – Domain registration data
  - 'nslookup' – DNS record lookup
  - 'theHarvester' – Email, subdomain, and open source data gathering
  - 'Shodan.io' – Internet-connected device search engine
- Discovered open ports using:
  nmap -sV
